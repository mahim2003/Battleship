# Battleship  
### Description
My group and I are working on creating our own version of Battleship with additional features that make the game fun and interesting, for example, playing an action card that allows you to guess 3 times in a row. The game is still in its initial stages, and can only be played with an AI at the moment, but eventually will be made multiplayer with the additional features implemented.
