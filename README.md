# Battleship  
## Group Salamander
### Description
Our group is working on creating our own version of Battleship with additional features that make the game fun and interesting, for example, playing an action card that allows you to guess 3 times in a row. The game is still in its initial stages, and can only be played with an AI at the moment, but eventually will be made multiplayer with the additional features implemented.
